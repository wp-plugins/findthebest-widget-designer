Enables data-driven publishers and bloggers to easily add interactive, customizable and unbiased product, service and reference listings.

== Description ==

At FindTheBest, we present you with the facts stripped of any marketing influence so that you can make quick and informed decisions. We present the facts in easy-to-use format with smart filters, so that you can decide what is best.

Too often, marketers and pay-to-play sites team up to present carefully crafted advertisements as objective "best of" lists. As a result, it has become difficult and time consuming to distinguish objective information from paid placements. Our goal is to become a trusted source in assisting you in life's important decisions.

FindTheBestâ€™s WordPress plugin enables data-driven publishers and bloggers to easily add interactive, customizable and unbiased product, service and reference listings to their own blogs and websites.

Special thanks to the TechCrunch Development team.
