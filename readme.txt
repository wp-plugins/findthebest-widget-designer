Add relevant, interactive content to any WordPress post.

== Description ==

Add relevant, interactive content to any WordPress post. Our plugin turns plain
text into visually engaging articles, with images, slideshows, side-by-side
comparisons, and deep details on people, organizations, products, and services.

To begin, start typing your article. When you’d like to add interactive content,
search for a topic in the top right search bar. Then, click on a suggestion
below that matches the content in your post.

You’ll enter the widget designer, where you can adjust sizing, choose what
information to add or take out, and pick an overall style (list view,
side-by-side, slideshow, detail display).

The content will appear as a gray placeholder within your article. To see the
content in action, simply preview or publish your post.

The plugin includes over 1,500 topics (ex: medical school), 460 million entities
(ex: John Hopkins School of Medicine), and billions of points of information
(ex: median MCAT scores for incoming medical students).

Adjust your widget's size, pick the info you want to include, then choose the

details on one topic.
